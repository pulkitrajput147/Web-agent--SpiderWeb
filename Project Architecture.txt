Project Architecture Overview:

1. Data Scraping and Storage Agent (Agent 1):

Utilize a web scraping library (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) to extract content from the specified website URL (www.knovatekinc.com).
Structure the scraped data and save it in a JSON file.
Implement error handling for cases like unsuccessful web scraping.

2. Query Answering Agent (Agent 2):

Design a vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of scraped data.
Develop a query processing module to interact with the vector database.
Implement the ability to answer user queries based on the stored data.

3. Integration:

Develop a communication interface between Agent 1 and Agent 2.
Ensure that Agent 2 can retrieve relevant information from the vector database(Arango) based on user queries.
